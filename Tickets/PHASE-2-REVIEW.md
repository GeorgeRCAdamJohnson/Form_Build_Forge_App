# Phase 2 Review: Core Form Builder

## Completed Features ‚úÖ
- **FormBuilder React component** - Main UI with field selection
- **Field selection UI** - Click to add fields from available list
- **Field reordering** - Up/down arrow buttons to move fields
- **Template save functionality** - Save with name validation
- **Template load functionality** - Dropdown to load saved templates
- **Form validation** - Prevents empty saves, duplicate field detection
- **Field filtering** - Available fields hide already selected ones
- **Admin interface with tabs** - Form Builder, Browse Templates, View Form, README

## Current Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **No persistent storage** - Templates lost on page refresh (in-memory only)
- **Mock Jira fields** - Using hardcoded field list, not real Jira API
- **No resolver connection** - Frontend can't communicate with backend
- **No issue panel integration** - Only admin interface works

## Technical Debt üîß
- TICKET-003: Custom UI resolver connection still unresolved
- Need to implement Forge Storage API
- Need to connect real Jira field discovery

## Phase 2 Status
**FUNCTIONALLY COMPLETE** - All UI features work with mock data
**TECHNICALLY INCOMPLETE** - Missing backend integration and persistence

## Ready for Phase 3?
‚úÖ **YES** - UI foundation is solid, ready to add real storage and Jira integration
